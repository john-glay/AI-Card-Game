            <h2 class="subtitle">Rules of the Game</h2>
            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: 500;">Setup:</p>
            <p>Each player is equipped with a carefully constructed deck consisting of 5 Rock cards (4 base damage), 5 Scissors cards (5 base damage), and 5 Paper cards (3 base damage). To enhance gameplay strategy, each deck also includes special Power-Up cards: 3 Fire Power-Ups, which add 2 bonus damage to a played card; 3 Thunder Power-Ups, which stun the opponent and prevent them from using any Power-Up cards in the next round; and 3 Water Power-Ups, which neutralize the effects of Fire Power-Ups and reduce incoming damage by 1. At the beginning of the game, each player's deck is shuffled, and they draw 5 random cards to form their starting hand. Each player starts with 30 health points, and the goal is to use a combination of base cards and Power-Ups to strategically attack the opponent and reduce their health to zero while managing one's own health and resources effectively.</p>
