                <h1>How To Play</h1>
                <p>Each player is equipped with a carefully constructed deck consisting of 5 Rock cards, 5 Scissors cards, and 5 Paper cards. To enhance gameplay strategy, each deck also includes special Power-Up cards: 3 Fire Power-Ups, 3 Thunder Power-Ups, and 3 Water Power-Ups. At the beginning of the game, each player's deck is shuffled, and they draw 5 random cards to form their starting hand. Each player starts with 30 health points, and the goal is to use a combination of base cards and Power-Ups to strategically attack the opponent and reduce their health to zero while managing one's own health and resources effectively.</p>
